# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
Aim of the analysis is to find the factors that affect a country's GDP per capita. The dataset takes 227 countries into consideration. There are different factors reated as variables which has values affecting the particular area.

Exploratory Data Analysis is the method used in analysing the dataset which often is done using visual methods. The main characterstics of the data is summarised in this kind of analysis. We have used histplots, subplots, distplots to determine the analysis. To determine if the factor is left or right skewed, we have used boxplot.

There are null or missing values in the data set as well. We have to figure out on what should be done for null values, as we cannot ignore them. After the analysis of the output of the functions, we can see that Phones (per 1000), Literacy, Service and Birthrate are the variables that affect the GDP.
